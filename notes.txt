Should we ensure corpus name is unique?

When we design our URLs if you're viewing something for a particular
corpus it makes sense to have that be part of the URL (makes them more
clear). But then we'd get into trouble if we don't assume corpus names
are unique. Can we enforce this in the DB? It would certainly simplify
things...
